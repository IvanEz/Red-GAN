Segmentation models is python library with Neural Networks for Image Segmentation based on PyTorch adopted from https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch.

The main features of this library are:

 - High level API (just two lines to create neural network)
 - 4 models architectures for binary and multi class segmentation (including legendary Unet)
 - 30 available encoders for each architecture
 - All encoders have pre-trained weights for faster and better convergence
