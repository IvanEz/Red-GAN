# Red-GAN

The repository contains code used for the *"Red-GAN: Attacking class imbalance via conditioned generation. Yet another medical imaging perspective"* accepted at MIDL2020 (http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10734 ).

### Training
To use the three player design introduced in the paper, please step to the `unet` folder first and check out the instruction. Once the unet is trained, step to the `gan` folder.

To use the vanila SPADE architecture, step to the `gan` folder right away and specify `--segmentator` option as `None`

### Requirements
Both GAN and U-Net parts are written in Pytorch. For further installation requirements, please check the corresponding folders.
